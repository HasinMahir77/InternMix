### Frontend Architecture
*   **Component-Based:** Modular and reusable components.
    *   `src/pages`: Top-level components for each route.
    *   `src/components`: Reusable UI elements (`Header`, `Footer`).
    *   `src/context`: Global state management (`AuthContext`).
*   **Routing:** `App.tsx` defines all application routes.

### Backend Architecture (Planned)
*   **API Design:** RESTful API.
*   **Database Schema:** `backend/models.py` defines the data structures for interns and recruiters, ensuring data consistency.

# Slide 7: Code Highlights

### `App.tsx` - Frontend Routing
*   Defines the application's routes and wraps them in an `AuthProvider` to manage state.
*   **[Screenshot: The code for `App.tsx` in your editor]**
    ```typescript
    // src/App.tsx
    <AuthProvider>
      <Router>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
          <Route path="/login" element={<Login />} />
          {/* ... more routes */}
        </Routes>
      </Router>
    </AuthProvider>
    ```

### `tailwind.config.js` - Custom Styling
*   Extends Tailwind's default theme with a custom color palette and animations.
*   **[Screenshot: The `theme.extend` section of `tailwind.config.js`]**
    ```javascript
    // tailwind.config.js
    extend: {
      colors: { /* Custom color palette */ },
      animation: { /* Custom animations */ },
    }
    ```

### `backend/models.py` - Data Modeling
*   Pydantic models define the data structure and validation rules for the backend.
*   **[Screenshot: The `Intern` class in `backend/models.py`]**
    ```python
    # backend/models.py
    class Intern(BaseModel):
        first_name: str
        last_name: str
        email: str
        # ... other fields
    ```
